# color-flipper

A JavaScript project made to randomly generate a color and display its Hex or Rgba code.

# What I Learned/Skills Used

• Using HTML and CSS to build my front-end UI

• Using CSS :root selector to make a color palette

• Using CSS :hover selector to create button transitions

• Using JavaScript Math.random() and Math.floor() object methods to generate random numbers using an arrays structure

• Using logical operations to make sure random numbers meet parameters of color code syntax

• Using JavaScript to change the background to the random color generated as well as display color code

**This is a concept and learning project
